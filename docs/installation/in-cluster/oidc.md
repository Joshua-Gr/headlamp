Headlamp supports OIDC for cluster users to effortlessly log in using a "Sign in" button.

To use OIDC, Headlamp needs to know how to configure it, so you have to provide the following OIDC-related arguments to Headlamp from your OIDC provider:

- the client ID: `-oidc-client-id` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
- the client secret: `-oidc-client-secret` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`
- the issuer URL: `-oidc-idp-issuer-url` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_IDP_ISSUER_URL`
- (optionally) the OpenId scopes: `-oidc-scopes` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_SCOPES`

and you have to tell the OIDC provider about the callback URL, which in Headlamp it is your URL + the `/oidc-callback` path, e.g.:
`https://YOUR_URL/oidc-callback`.

### Callback URL

You must tell your OIDC provider the callback URL that Headlamp will use after login. This is your Headlamp URL plus `/oidc-callback`, for example:

```
https://YOUR_URL/oidc-callback
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** If you're running Headlamp behind an ingress or load balancer (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB/NLB), make sure it forwards the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. Otherwise, Headlamp may generate the callback URL using `http` instead of `https`, which can cause a mismatch with your OIDC provider.
>
> For [NGINX ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/), you can add:
>
> ```yaml
> nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
>   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
> ```

### Troubleshooting: Real time updates not working, Large JWT Tokens with Ingress NGINX

If you notice real time updates not working, this could be the cause.

If your OIDC provider issues large JWT tokens (e.g., >8KB), you may encounter issues with WebSocket connections or authentication headers being truncated when using Headlamp behind an Ingress NGINX controller.

To resolve this, increase the header buffer size using the following annotation in your [NGINX Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/) resource:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |-
  large_client_header_buffers 4 64k;
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** Regular HTTP requests may still work even with large tokens, but WebSocket connections are more sensitive to header size limits and may fail unless this buffer is increased.

### Scopes

Besides the mandatory _openid_ scope, Headlamp also requests the optional
_profile_ and _email_
[scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes).
Scopes can be overridden by using the `-oidc-scopes` option. Remember to
include the default ones if you need them when using that option.
For example, if you need to keep the default scopes and add Github's `repo`,
then add them all to the option:

`-oidc-scopes=profile,email,repo`

**Note:** Before Headlamp 0.3.0, a scope _groups_ was also included, as it's
used by Dex and other services, but since it's not part of the default spec,
it was removed in the mentioned version.

### Token Validation Overrides

In the event your OIDC Provider issues `access_tokens` from a different Issuer URL or clientID audience than its `id_tokens` (i.e. Azure Entra ID) you may have need of the following parameters to configure what is used in validation of tokens.

- `-oidc-validator-client-id=<clientID audience to validate in token>` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_VALIDATOR_CLIENT_ID` which is the clientID headlamp should be verifying in the `aud` field of the token provided back from the OIDC provider.
- `-oidc-validator-idp-issuer-url=<issuerURL to use in validation>` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_VALIDATOR_IDP_ISSUER_URL` which is the IssuerURL headlamp should be verifying in the `iss` field of the token provided back from the OIDC Provider

### Use Access Tokens instead of ID Tokens

Be default, headlamp leverages the `id_token` provided back from the OIDC Provider after authentication returned to the `/oidc-callback` endpoint. For some Identity Providers like Azure Entra ID, the `access_token` is what is used for authorization to Kubernetes clusters. To instruct headlamp to use the `access_token` instead of the `id_token`, the following flag can be used.

- `-oidc-use-access-token=true` or env var `HEADLAMP_CONFIG_OIDC_USE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### Example: OIDC with Keycloak in Minikube

If you are interested in a comprehensive example of using OIDC and Headlamp,
you can check the
[tutorial on setting up OIDC with Keycloack in Minikube](./keycloak/).

### Example: OIDC with Entra ID in AKS

If you are interested in a comprehensive tutorial of using OIDC and Headlamp in AKS,
you can check the
[tutorial on setting up OIDC with Entra ID in AKS](./azure-entra-id/).

For quick reference if you are already familiar with setting up Entra ID,

- Add the callback URL (e.g. `https://YOUR_URL/oidc-callback`) to your Azure App Registration's `redirectURIs`
- Set `-oidc-client-id` to your Azure App Registration's clientID
- Set `-oidc-client-secret` to your Azure App Registration's clientSecret
- Set `-oidc-idp-issuer-url` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Your Azure Directory (tenant) ID>/v2.0`
- Set `-oidc-scopes` to `6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630/user.read openid email profile`
- Set `--oidc-validator-idp-issuer-url` to `https://sts.windows.net/<Your Directory (tenant) ID>/`
- Set `-oidc-validator-client-id` to `6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630`
- Set `-oidc-use-access-token=true`


### Example: OIDC with Dex

If you are using Dex and want to configure Headlamp to use it for OIDC,
then you have to:

- Add the callback URL (e.g. `https://YOUR_URL/oidc-callback`) to Dex's `staticClient.redirectURIs`
- Set `-oidc-client-id` as Dex's `staticClient.id`
- Set `-oidc-client-secret` as Dex's `staticClient.secret`
- Set `-oidc-idp-issuer-url` as Dex's URL (same as in `--oidc-issuer-url` in the Kubernetes APIServer)
- Set `-oidc-scopes` if needed, e.g. `-oidc-scopes=profile,email,groups`

**Note** If you already have another static client configured for Kubernetes for the [apiserver's OIDC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#configuring-the-api-server) (OpenID Connect) configuration, use a **single static client ID** i.e `-oidc-client-id` for both Dex and Headlamp. Additionally, the **redirectURIs** need to be specified for each client.
